# ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Project

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a raw dataset to make it ready for data analysis or modeling. The dataset was chosen from Kaggle and contained common real-world issues such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and incorrect data types.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas)
- Google Colab / VS Code
- CSV format for input/output

## ðŸ§ª Dataset
**Dataset Used**: Data.ZIP (# The project file exceeds 25MB, so I will be uploading it as a .zip archive.)  
Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  

## ðŸ§¼ Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps
- âœ… Identified and handled missing values using `isnull()` and `fillna()` / `dropna()`
- âœ… Removed duplicate records using `drop_duplicates()`
- âœ… Standardized categorical text values (e.g., gender, country)
- âœ… Converted date columns to consistent `datetime` format (e.g., dd-mm-yyyy)
- âœ… Renamed column headers to lowercase and removed spaces
- âœ… Fixed data types for numerical and datetime columns

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this Repository
- `raw_dataset.csv` â€“ Original uncleaned dataset (optional)
- `Sales_Data.py` â€“ Python script for cleaning the dataset
- `summary_of_changes.txt` â€“ Summary of all changes made
- `README.md` â€“ This file

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings
- Practical experience with data cleaning using Pandas
- Dealing with real-world data issues
- Understanding the importance of clean data in Data Analyst workflows.


ðŸ“Š Behind every great insight is a clean dataset â€” itâ€™s where meaningful analysis truly begins!
