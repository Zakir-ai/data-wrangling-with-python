# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Project

## 📌 Objective
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a raw dataset to make it ready for data analysis or modeling. The dataset was chosen from Kaggle and contained common real-world issues such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and incorrect data types.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 🐼 [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – for data manipulation  
- 🔢 [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) – for numerical operations  
- 📊 [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) – for basic visualizations  
- 📉 [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) – for enhanced data visualizations  
- ☁️ [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) – for coding in the cloud

## 🧪 Dataset

**Dataset Used**: Data.ZIP (# The project file exceeds 25MB, so I will be uploading it as a .zip archive.)  
Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  

## 🧼 Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps

- ✅ Identified and handled missing values using `isnull()` and `fillna()` / `dropna()`
- ✅ Removed duplicate records using `drop_duplicates()`
- ✅ Standardized categorical text values (e.g., gender, country)
- ✅ Converted date columns to consistent `datetime` format (e.g., dd-mm-yyyy)
- ✅ Renamed column headers to lowercase and removed spaces
- ✅ Fixed data types for numerical and datetime columns
